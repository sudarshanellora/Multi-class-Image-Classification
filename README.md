The COVID-19 is a viral infection that majorly affected the human respiratory system was found on December 31,2019 in Wuhan,China where several cluster of cases of pneumonia were found and the reason for sudden outbreak of pneumonia cases were unknown. On reporting to WHO about the cluster of cases and WHO declared it as a transmission disease. The COVID-19 patients were exhibiting a number of symptoms . The symptoms included were cough, fever,soar throat,tiredness ,respiratory diseases[2]. The symptoms were likely to be shown between 11-14 days . The major tests which were conducted were RT-PCR , CT scan . While RT-PCR used throat swab sample of a patient[1] to identify the infection ,CT scan used images to detect the presence of COVID-19.As time passed , the number of cases increased with increase in mortality rate among the patients admitted to the hospital[1]. With the increase in cases, there lead to shortage of RT-PCR kits which lead the health care to switch to use.Radiography images to detect the infection .The data which consists of Radiographic metadata and image data in large number, diverse and complex data structure which is difficult to visualize or analyze using any computational methods. For this kind of unstructured data, the common approach is Machine learning, but Deep learning techniques is used regularly and which is more popular. Where in Machine learning algorithms which classifies between 0 or 1 and whereas Deep learning algorithms mediate from 0 to1. Deep learning algorithms such as CNN,Resnet,Unet,MobileV2net were implemented and algorithms accuracy were 95.42%, 70.12%, 93.30% and 89.75%. Among all the mentioned algorithms CNN outperformed well with a classification accuracy of 95.42%.
